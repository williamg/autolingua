# Autolingua Vocabulary & Morphology
## Morphology
**Adverbification**: Both nouns and adjectives can be
adverbified by prepending `a` if the word begins with a consonant and `an` if
it begins with a vowel. The literal translation of this is more clear with
adjectives than it is for verbs.

_Examples_:
- `golen` (happy) becomes `agolen` (happily)
- `oto` (robot) becomes `anoto` (robotically, in a robot-like way)

**Nounification**: Verbs can be transformed into nouns in the following ways:
- Append `i` or `si`  to a verb that ends in a consonant or vowel, respectively
to turn it into a biological entity that does that verb
- Append `o` or `so` to a verb that ends in a consonant or vowel, respecitvely
to turn it into a robot that does that verb

_Examples_:
- `telse` (compute/think) becomes `telseso` (robot computer)
- `bust` (work) becomes `busti` (human worker)

Adjectives can be changed into nouns in the following ways:
- Append `and` or `nd` to a verb that ends in a consonant or vowel, respectively
to turn it into the "metric" used to measure a particular verb.

_Examples_:
- `nelog` (unhappy) becomes `nelogand` (unhappiness)
- `lusfuno` (different) becomes `lusfunond` (differences)

**Pluralization**: To make a noun plural, simply append `est`, regardless of
how it ends.

_Examples_:
- `mimitso` (child) becomes `mimitsoest` (children)

**Verb Number**: Verbs implicitly have a certain number of arguments that they
expect. Some verbs only appear in one form or another. When a verb can appear
in multiple forms:
- The unaltered verb will expect both a subject and an object
- Appending `a` or `ta` will expect ONLY a subject
- Appending `u` or `to` will expect ONLY an object

### Numbers
Autolingua uses a base-16 (hexadecimal) number system with the following numerals:
```
0 lo
1 li
2: ta
3: tu
4: fe
5: kai
6: sa
7: se
8: ku
9: me
A: ma
B: bu
C: ka
D: da
E: et
F: fu
```
As in most computers, the word for 0 is the same as the word for "false" or "no"
and the word for 1 is the same as the word for "true" or "yes".

To say a larger number, for example, 42, first convert the number to hexadecimal:
0x2A and then simply say the numerals: `tama`. The word for 525,600 is bulokaitalo.


### Misc
```
ut - Shows possession (ut A B) is the same as A's B
usu - Can be used once anywhere in a sentence to indicate a request for a value
that, when substituted, would make the sentence true
```

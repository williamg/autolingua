## They're Made out of Meat

English:
```
"Meat. They're made out of meat."
"Meat?"
"There's no doubt about it. We picked up several from different parts of the
planet, took them abord our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through.
They're completely meat."

That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars.
